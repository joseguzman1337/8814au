| Issue | User Report Focus | Current Status | Resolution Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| #160 | User-specific support/build/runtime report | support | Capture reproducible logs with `tools/runtime-healthcheck.sh`, classify as support vs code defect, and attach exact repro/environment for next patch. |
| #159 | DKMS staging/build break on Kali 6.16.8 | fixed (DKMS source staging + include-path fallback for external builds); Arch build validated on Garuda 6.18.9-zen | Use installer/Makefile hardening already in PR; run build-only validation and DKMS status checks. Compare logs against generated healthcheck artifacts. |
| #158 | USB mode switch loop disconnects adapter | mitigated (added guard to prevent repeated forced USB mode-switch disconnect loops within a module lifetime) | Kernel-facing driver logic patched in PR. Reproduce on target hardware and confirm warning/error signatures disappear with same workload. |
| #157 | Request to increase RF power output | support (documented tx power/regulatory guidance in README troubleshooting) | User guidance captured in README troubleshooting; validate with runtime-healthcheck evidence and connection profile settings. |
| #156 | iw monitor info missing channel/bandwidth fields | partially mitigated (added cfg80211 channel switch notify on monitor-channel set path; runtime healthcheck now also flags DOWN-link cases where `iw` may omit channel output) | Use hot-plug workflow: run `tools/hot-switch-driver.sh` (or `tools/hotplug-issue-suite.sh`) to A/B native vs out-of-tree binding, collect snapshots, then lock policy to one driver in maintenance window. |
| #155 | Linux Mint connectivity stabilized via BSSID/MAC profile changes | support (documented NetworkManager BSSID/MAC-randomization stability hint in README) | User guidance captured in README troubleshooting; validate with runtime-healthcheck evidence and connection profile settings. |
| #153 | User-specific support/build/runtime report | support | Capture reproducible logs with `tools/runtime-healthcheck.sh`, classify as support vs code defect, and attach exact repro/environment for next patch. |
| #152 | Segfault/warn during driver reload disconnect path | fixed (guard unexpected disconnect state during teardown) | Kernel-facing driver logic patched in PR. Reproduce on target hardware and confirm warning/error signatures disappear with same workload. |
| #149 | AWUS1900 usability on modern distro/kernel | support (added explicit AWUS1900 runtime binding diagnostics in tools/runtime-healthcheck.sh) | Use hot-plug workflow: run `tools/hot-switch-driver.sh` (or `tools/hotplug-issue-suite.sh`) to A/B native vs out-of-tree binding, collect snapshots, then lock policy to one driver in maintenance window. |
| #148 | Secure Boot non-DKMS sign-install failure | fixed (Makefile sign-install target already corrected in current branch) | Use installer/Makefile hardening already in PR; run build-only validation and DKMS status checks. Compare logs against generated healthcheck artifacts. |
| #147 | Yocto minimal build-root failure | partially mitigated (removed `bc` dependency from both Makefile GCC version check and install script preflight for minimal build roots) | Use installer/Makefile hardening already in PR; run build-only validation and DKMS status checks. Compare logs against generated healthcheck artifacts. |
| #145 | Monitor capture length mismatch (tp_snaplen/radiotap) | partially mitigated (radiotap no longer unconditionally advertises appended FCS, avoiding misleading capture-length interpretation) | Kernel-facing driver logic patched in PR. Reproduce on target hardware and confirm warning/error signatures disappear with same workload. |
| #143 | User-specific support/build/runtime report | support | Capture reproducible logs with `tools/runtime-healthcheck.sh`, classify as support vs code defect, and attach exact repro/environment for next patch. |
| #141 | Arch/Zen runtime bind conflict and non-working state | fixed/mitigated (added install-time blacklist for in-kernel `rtw88_8814au` to prevent USB ID binding conflicts with out-of-tree `8814au`; added install/remove runtime conflict warnings; added snapshot-backed hot-switch script to rebind without recompile/uninstall/reboot; validated both native<->oot switch directions on sx1) | Use hot-plug workflow: run `tools/hot-switch-driver.sh` (or `tools/hotplug-issue-suite.sh`) to A/B native vs out-of-tree binding, collect snapshots, then lock policy to one driver in maintenance window. |
| #140 | DKMS build/install lifecycle inconsistencies | fixed (Arch validation: clean DKMS remove/install now removes stale versions and installs current version successfully) | Use installer/Makefile hardening already in PR; run build-only validation and DKMS status checks. Compare logs against generated healthcheck artifacts. |

| #133 | 5 GHz behavior inconsistency | partially mitigated (addressed driver-binding conflict that can attach the wrong rtl8814au implementation on modern kernels; validated conflicting binding condition on sx1) | Use hot-plug workflow: run `tools/hot-switch-driver.sh` (or `tools/hotplug-issue-suite.sh`) to A/B native vs out-of-tree binding, collect snapshots, then lock policy to one driver in maintenance window. |
